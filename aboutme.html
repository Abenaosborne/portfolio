<p>Hi, My name Abena Osborne.I'm 13 yrs and I go to unity prep as a 8th grader.I live in Brooklyn with my aunt and five cousin and my sister. During my free time, I like to make dance and sing and play pranks on my cousins and sister.My favorite subject is math because I feel myself understanding every lesson.Sometimes I might not understand certain things when teach the same day but the next day I do be understanding it. Computer is my second favorite subject because you don't get homework, we usually use the computers to make our projects and sometimes once in a while we get test on jupiter.
